# bscpp-Shaders

Shaders that I've made for BSCPP. The majority of them were made with Amplify and may contain some internal code leftovers from the port. I don't recommend using these shaders for custom models since these don't use Stereo Fixed fog. These shaders can be used for decomp projects like this one.

Some shaders like the ParameticBox shader are omitted since they are decompiled [here. (OpenShaders-0.11.2)](https://github.com/whatdahopper/OpenShaders-0.11.2) 

## Shader progress
Almost all shaders here are recreated/fixed. There are some inconsistencies like BlueNoise being omitted and mirrors being slightly broken. 0.12+ spectrograms haven't been recreated yet.
