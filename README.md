# bsptk-Shaders

Shaders that I've made for BSPTK. The majority of them were made with Amplify and may contain some internal code leftovers from the port. You can use these shaders with custom models [Ex. Vivify maps, Custom Sabers] though be warned you may run into some problems due to Bloomfog not being stereo fixed.
Some shaders like the ParameticBox shader are omitted since they are decompiled [here.(OpenShaders-0.11.2)](https://github.com/whatdahopper/OpenShaders-0.11.2) 

## Shader progress
Almost all shaders here are recreated/fixed. There are some inconsistencies like BlueNoise being omitted and mirrors being slightly broken. 0.12+ spectrograms haven't been recreated yet.
