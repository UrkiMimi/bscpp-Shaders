# bscpp-Shaders

Shaders that I've made for BSCPP. The majority of them were made with Amplify and may contain some internal code leftovers from the port. I don't recommend using these shaders for custom models since these don't use Stereo Fixed fog. 

Some shaders like the ParameticBox shader are omitted since they are decompiled [here. (OpenShaders-0.11.2)](https://github.com/whatdahopper/OpenShaders-0.11.2)
